//! Hourly S3 storage sweep: single-flight background task, cached snapshot,
//! re-emitted every usage-metrics tick.
//!
//! See `PLANS/S3_STORAGE_METRICS_PLAN.md` (Rev 3) "Sweep architecture" for
//! the full design; this module implements the relay-side half (the
//! classifier + pure fold live in `buzz_media::bucket_index`). Summary:
//!
//! - The usage tick never awaits the sweep. [`maybe_spawn_sweep`] harvests
//!   any finished in-flight attempt into the cache, then spawns at most one
//!   new attempt (single-flight) when the cadence/failure rule allows it.
//! - [`emit_storage_metrics`] is called every tick, leader-only, and
//!   re-publishes the cached snapshot regardless of whether a sweep is
//!   currently running — DB-derived gauges keep their configured cadence,
//!   storage gauges lag by at most one tick after a sweep completes.
//! - In inline mode, a cold cache (no sweep has ever succeeded) publishes
//!   health gauges only (`sweep_ok=0`); a warm cache re-publishes the last good
//!   snapshot even while the newest attempt is failing, so a transient S3 blip
//!   never blanks the dashboards.
