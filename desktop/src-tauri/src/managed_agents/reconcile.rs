//! Boot-time disk↔relay reconcile for managed-agent (kind:30177) events.
//!
//! `run_event_sync` already reconciles personas (30175) and teams (30176)
//! into the retention store at boot; managed agents were the missing leg —
//! their events were enqueued only on the interactive save path
//! (`retain_managed_agent_pending`), so a record edited on disk between
//! launches, or a save whose publish was missed, silently diverged from the
//! relay. This module mirrors `migrate_personas_in_dir`: per-coordinate
//! content diff, monotonic `created_at` bump, retain with `pending_sync = 1`
//! for the existing flush loop.
//!
//! Best-effort contract (decided in #centralize-personas-and-agents):
//! - No file watcher — hand edits are picked up at next boot only.
//! - No deletion reconcile — a record absent from `managed-agents.json` is
//!   left untouched in retention; a truncated or partial file must never
//!   trigger tombstones.
//! - A malformed store fails loudly: the broken file is preserved as
//!   `managed-agents.json.invalid` (see [`super::storage::backup_invalid_store`])
//!   and an error is returned, never silently skipped.
