//! Login-shell resolution for spawned PTY children.
//!
//! Tyler asked for the user's shell of choice, so the resolution order is the
//! user's own: `$SHELL`, then the passwd entry, then `/bin/sh`. What matters
//! is the *validity* test applied at each step, and it is not "the path
//! exists".
//!
//! `portable-pty` gates both steps on `access(X_OK)` (`cmdbuilder.rs:545-553`
//! for `$SHELL`, `:43-71` for passwd). `access(X_OK)` answers "may I execute
//! this" for *any* file type, and a directory carries the execute bit to mean
//! "may I traverse it" — so `access("/tmp", X_OK)` returns 0. Verified by C
//! repro and end-to-end through a real PTY: with `SHELL=/tmp`,
//! `CommandBuilder::get_shell()` returns `"/tmp"`, `spawn_command` returns
//! `Ok`, and the child dies with exit code 1 after printing
//! `fatal runtime error: assertion failed: output.write(&bytes).is_ok()`.
//! The user gets a terminal that opens and instantly dies with a Rust runtime
//! panic, and every layer above reported success.
//!
//! So we require an **executable regular file**, following symlinks: `stat`
//! rather than `lstat` semantics, because `/bin/sh` is legitimately a symlink
//! on many systems. A directory or a non-executable file falls through to the
//! next candidate instead of becoming an unspawnable child.

/// The conjunction is load-bearing and neither half suffices:
///
/// - `access(X_OK)` alone accepts a **directory** — the execute bit means
///   *traverse* there, so `access("/tmp", X_OK) == 0`. That is the bug
///   inherited from `portable-pty` (`cmdbuilder.rs:545-553`): with
///   `SHELL=/tmp` the child aborts with a Rust runtime panic while every
///   layer reports success.
/// - Raw `mode & 0o111` alone accepts a file the caller **cannot** execute.
///   The bits say *some* class has execute permission, not the applicable
///   one, and they do not evaluate ACLs. Verified with a self-owned regular
///   file at mode `0o010`: `mode & 0o111` is true, `access(X_OK)` is -1, and
///   running it gives `Permission denied`.
